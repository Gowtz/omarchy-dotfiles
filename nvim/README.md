# Neovim configuration

This is my Neovim configuration, which I use for programming and writing. It is designed to be minimal, fast, and easy to use.

## Features

- Minimal and fast
- Easy to use
- Supports multiple programming languages
- Customizable
- Integrated with Git
- Autocompletion
- Syntax highlighting
- File explorer
- Fuzzy finder
- Terminal integration

- LSP support
  - LSP config change to `vim.lsp`. Still facing the issue of usingthe lspconfig using mason and manual config
